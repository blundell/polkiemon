## Functionality

### Required

1. When the application starts, load and show a paginated Pokemon list, obtained from
the endpoint. (Show name and image for each Pokemon)
2. When a Pokemon is selected, show a detailed view.
3. Give an option to refresh the list.
4. Show error info if the list cannot be loaded (eg: no network)

### Bonus

1. Manage configuration changes, ideally without reloading the list.
2. Add an offline mechanism so the application can work even with no network.
3. Add some animations (fade in/fade out animations, etc)
4. Add an option to search for a Pokemon by name.


// I have not done landscape designs, you get less details in landscape.
